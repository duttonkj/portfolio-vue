    text: 'I\'ve worked with Kevin for over 4 years, and there\'s no one I\'d rather work on a project with. He\'s a highly skilled developer who is confident without having a chip on his shoulder. That sounds like a small thing, but if you\'re 70 hours into an 80 hour week and up against a deadline, there\'s nothing more valuable than a level headed developer with Kevin\'s depth of knowledge whose primary motivation is to deliver the best product possible and not serve his own ego. Kevin is a team player and a great mentor to the less seasoned members of our development team. Likewise, he\'s always willing to take time to explain complicated concepts in a way that\'s understandable to folks on our full project teams (account services, project management, etc.) who have no development background. I\'ve worked at a handful of companies in our industry, and "Can we get Kevin Dutton?" is one of the first things I say to anyone in a position to bring him on board.'

    text: 'Kevin is one of the best developers I\'ve had the opportunity to work with. Without question, the most dedicated. And an all around awesome person, too. As tech director in the Creative Studio and a focus on front-end web technology (though in practice more than capable of digging into anything/everything), Kevin is very hands-on lead for projects and the web discipline. He earned the respect of clients, peers and team members and always found solutions that balanced needs of the user with the appropriate approach. Any team would be lucky have him.'

    text: 'As the Technical Director of our team, Kevin created a work environment that was focused on creating interesting products and a comfortable team atmosphere. I had the opportunity to work with him as a developer on numerous projects. Kevin brought more to his role than just excellent management. He acted as a mentor to team members, served as a role model for coding practices, and inspired the other developers with his passion for learning and trying new approaches to solve problems. His ability to recall technical details and code implementations for even old projects never failed to impress me, and made Kevin a knowledge cornerstone for all of our projects. As a mentor, Kevin listens to everyone on the team and makes their efforts feel valued. His rare mix of boundless productivity and consideration of all team members sets a great example, earning my highest respect. I would happily work on any of Kevin\'s teams in the future.'

    text: 'Kevin Dutton is an extremely talented developer who will be a huge asset to any company that is lucky enough to employ him. He is one of the most talented all around developers I have ever known. What makes Kevin so great? He is a true full stack developer who is completely comfortable with all stages of development. His strongest talents are in front end development where he is an honest to goodness front end master, but he is quick to jump in on any project. But the best thing about Kevin is how he makes everyone around him better. The teams he works with are more productive and the people around him are growing and learning. He is someone you can trust and depend on, even when the problems arise. He is one of those developers who will be there when you need him doing whatever is necessary to get the job done on time. It has been an honor to work with Kevin and I really could not recommend him higher.'
